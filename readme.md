# Teamtrees viewer

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CrispyBacon1999/teamtrees.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CrispyBacon1999/teamtrees)

This is a cli live counter for teamtrees.org. It defaults to a 10 second refresh time, but can be changed with `py trees.py 5`.

It will run in cmd and reformat the window to fit nicely with the ascii art.
